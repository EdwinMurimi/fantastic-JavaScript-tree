// The below is just a simple JS line to test on the browser
console.log("Hello World");

// Let's declare a few variables in JS

// This is the wrong way of doing things.
var nameIdentification = "John Doe";

// The below lines is the recommended way of declaring variables in  JS

// This is when the variable can change
let occupation = "Software Engineer";

// This is when the variable should not change
const salary = "Â£23,323.23"

// If I tried to change the value of salary then JS would throw an error

// Simple console logs below for us to visualize the data
console.log(nameIdentification);

console.log(occupation);

console.log(salary);
